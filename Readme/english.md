PROBLEM
=====
In discussing student learning social skills, cooperation, mentioning these concepts are describing the values ​​that the free software or open source software can provide, as these are based on the principle of collaborative work and teamwork, something that the education institutions seeking to highlight, however they omit to use non-free software, software that limits seek knowledge of the tool, limited to complying with given initial function, forgetting that part of the investigation was to determine the tool with which it works, but if you do not know the code, only know a part of the tool, and adapt it to the specific needs of the institution, in this case the IED Jose Marti, Simon Bolivar neighborhood, district of Barranquilla.
In Barranquilla proprietary software is often used illegally (violating licensing terms, you must not redistribute such copies thereof) from schools to homes, an example of this is to make the papers presented by computer in which use Microsoft Word but there are students who do not have purchasing power to buy the software then look for a copy on the internet and install it illegally, but why does this happen?, are there not alternatives to solve this problem?, do exist , in the present case is LibreOffice, there are other similar cases, but now comes the most important problem, ignorance of our youth about these alternatives.
as abstract logic complementary problem is handled in schools may not be enough to guide those who like to think in this way, so we need to arouse their curiosity in an attractive way using a visual language that close to reality as student lives and we want to create, you need to be visually appealing as if it were just text, rather than promoting the escape of these tools we have known where the computer in a different way could have discovered his vocation in this field.
JUSTIFICATION
=====
It is important to strengthen the educational community values ​​such as responsibility, respect, solidarity, democracy and honesty, using illegal programs, (violating the terms of software licenses) are putting aside. In addition, to encourage the development of programming from an early age, as currently in schools are not discussed and in most cases not even get to teach about how programs are made using daily (being software mainly proprietary) and many of these children are very interested and it is good to know the operation of their tools, may arise from them entrepreneurial projects, which would be legal, since the license allows the tool to change the software and present it as fork of the original project.
 
GOALS
